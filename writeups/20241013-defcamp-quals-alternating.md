Flag: `ctf{7ce5567830a2f9f8ce8a7e39856adfe5208242f6bce01ca9af1a230637d65a2d}`

Description:
> We have hidden something in the file and I'm sure you won't find it. Make sure to extract the archive using WinRar. Windows is your friend.

## Solution

The challenge provides a file, Flag.rar, that when extracted produces a file named `Flag.txt.txt`,
which is sadly empty.
Although the challenge description mentioned Windows,
I didn't have a Windows device available,
so the first thing I did was opening the file in an hex editor.
I was presented with this:

```

```

We can see that the file is pretty small,
and if we look carefully at the ASCII interpretation of the file,
we can spot that the string `real_flag.txt` appears.

Running `file Flag.rar` reveals that the given archive is a RAR v5 archive.
The RAR 5.0 specification has a helpful [General Archive Layout](https://www.rarlab.com/technote.htm#arclayout) section which
explains how a RAR file is composed:
after a header at the beginning of the file,
there is an array of file headers,
and each of them can optionally have one or more service headers.
If we scroll down a bit further,
the specification also explains how the file headers and service headers are structured;
interestingly, both types of headers are almost identical,
the only difference being the Header Type field,
which is `2` for a file header and `3`Â for a service header.

At this point, I hypothesized that the `Flag.txt.txt` string belonged to a file header,
while the `real_flag.txt` was a service header which was being ignored.
Since the Header Type field is located before the Name,
i walked backwards from the first character of `real_flag.txt` until I found a `0x03` byte,
with the hex editor changed that to a `0x02`, exported the file, and tried to extract it.
That still produced only `Flag.txt.txt`,
so I undid the change and repeated it on the previous `0x03`,
which also didn't work.
Luckily, as the old saying goes, third time's the charm: after patching the byte at offset 0x49,
two files were extracted: `Flag.txt.txt`, which was again empty, and a new file named `STM`, which 
contained the flag.
